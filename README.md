emberconf-2014-demo
===================

A demo app for two EmberConf 2014 presentations:

- Alex DiLiberto - [Extending Ember with Analytics](http://alexdiliberto.com/talks/extending-ember-with-analytics/#/)
- Nathan Hammond - [Controlling Route Traversal with Flows](http://emberconf.com/schedule.html#hammond)

## Notes

This application is in a mostly functional state as a demo. Any individual commit may break it, but issues are typically quickly patched.

```bash
npm install -g bower ember-cli@0.0.21
```

- After checkout `bower install && npm install` to populate the vendor folder. Alternatively, `ember init` does the same thing in a less verbose manner.
