emberconf-2014-demo
===================

A demo app for two EmberConf 2014 presentations:

- Alex DiLiberto - 
- Nathan Hammond - [Controlling Route Traversal with Flows](http://emberconf.com/schedule.html#hammond)

## Notes

```bash
npm install -g bower ember-cli
```

- In the event that things don't work see this issue: https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/issues/67
- After checkout `bower install` to populate the vendor folder. Alternatively, `ember init` does the same thing in a less verbose manner.
