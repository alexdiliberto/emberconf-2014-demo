emberconf-2014-demo
===================

A demo app for two EmberConf 2014 presentations:

- Alex DiLiberto - Extending Ember with Analytics
- Nathan Hammond - [Controlling Route Traversal with Flows](http://emberconf.com/schedule.html#hammond)

## Notes

IMPORTANT: This application is currently incomplete. In order to navigate around it you must directly manipulate the URL or even the underlying code. Just a note in case you're taking @nathanhammond up on the beer-or-coffee-for-code-review exchange. :)

```bash
npm install -g bower ember-cli@0.0.16
```

- After checkout `bower install && npm install` to populate the vendor folder. Alternatively, `ember init` does the same thing in a less verbose manner.
